“B-zen” project aims to create an improvisation and composition tool for vocals as a 
creative tool via gesture controlled system. 

Using the voice of the performer, this tool creates a wide variety of textures which normally 
cannot be produced by the unprocessed human voice. 

The environment consists of a Leap Motion (LM) controller and a custom-made software, 
developed in the SuperCollider (SC) programming language.

There are stages such as, developing the code which manipulates the vocal signal 
and mapping the parameters to the LM in SC. After these parameters are mapped to the LM 
by using the GECO platform through MIDI, the performer may control her/his voice 
and experiment the sonic outcomes with gestures using the LM controller. 

The main purpose of this project is to create a custom made and gesture control system 
for live performance used by vocalists within the genre of live electronics.
